## Dr. Robert Spangler Circuit Theory Bode, Lapalce and Fourier Analysis Presentation, Audio and Video Course Files

This repository includes course materials provided by Dr. Robert Spangler for an Electrical Engineering undergraduate course offered as an introduction to electric circuits.  The scope of the course and these presentations cover circuit analysis techniques applied to resistive circuits, circuits with energy storage devices, alternating current and 3 phase power circuits, and the analysis of the frequency response of circuits using the methodologies of Bode, Laplace and Fourier analysis.

## Content & Course Materials

Course materials include, but are not limited to the following categories:
* The course syllabus
* Microsoft Power Point presentations for the scheduled lecture topics and meetings described in the Course Syllabus
* Supplemental materials addressing calculation details associated with, for example, lecture examples, homework assignments, quiz and test problems etc.  
* Video recordings of lectures, class discussions and practice exercise sessions
* Miscellaneous pertinent readings and materials 

These materials, with the exception of video files, may be viewed in the github application or downloaded. Video files typically are available only for download.       The default format for video files is ‘mp4’ and they may be viewed in any video player including the Windows Media Player.
